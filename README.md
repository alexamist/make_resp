Scripts for calculating RESP charges with Gaussian, starting only with `.xyz` file of your compound. 

Generate `.mol2`, `.frcmod` and `.pdb` with calculated RESP charges, for Molecular Dynamic simulations in Amber.

## make_esp.sh
First, use `make_esp.sh` for run an optimization of your compound (in your desired level of theory) and a single point for ESP calculation, with HF/6-31G* (protocol for RESP charges, read more in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100142a004). 
For neutral molecules in a singlet state, otherwise, change input generation section of make_esp.sh!

**files needed:** compound.xyz

**packages needed:** Gaussian; marathon (https://github.com/dudektria/marathon) - for using Gaussian (or change the line where marathon is called, for the method you submit jobs in Gaussian)

**usage:** `./make_esp.sh` `xyz(without .xyz)` `opt_level(scape special characters, for gaussian input)` `nprocs-opt` `nprocs-esp`

**ex:** `./make_esp.sh` `compound` `MP2/6-311G\*` `8` `2`

   or  

   `nohup` `./make_esp.sh` `compound` `MP2/6-311G\*` `8` `2` `&`  (still running, even if you exit terminal, in background)

Press enter each gaussian run finishes.

## make-resp.sh
Before, use `make_resp.sh` for generating compound.mol2, compound.frcmod and compound.pdb with calculated RESP charges.

**files needed:** compound_esp.out (output from ESP calculation)

**packages needed:** antechamber; parmchk

**usage:** `./make_resp.sh`  `esp_output(without _esp.out)`  `residue_name`

   **ex:** `./make_resp.sh` `compound` `RES`
